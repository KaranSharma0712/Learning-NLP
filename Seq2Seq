Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) deep learning is a model architecture where one neural network processes
a sequence of input
data and generates a corresponding sequence of output data. It's commonly used for tasks
like machine translation or summarization, allowing the model to understand and produce variable-length sequences. The encoder-decoder structure is fundamental, with the encoder capturing input information, and the decoder generating the output sequence based on that encoded representation.
